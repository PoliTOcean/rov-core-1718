# rov-core

This is the repository related the internal ROV software.

It is divided in releases + an [_useful_stuff_](https://github.com/PoliTOcean/rov-core/tree/master/useful_stuff) folder.

The first ROV we created had only one atMega, its code is inside the [Alosa folder](https://github.com/PoliTOcean/rov-core/tree/master/Alosa).

The second ROV had one Raspberry with ROS and one atMega connected through SPI, all the codes are inside the [Blicca folder](https://github.com/PoliTOcean/rov-core/tree/master/Blicca).

Enjoy!
